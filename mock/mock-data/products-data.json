The portfolio manager uses a rules-based quantitative model to evaluate the securities in an investment universe to construct an equity portfolio that seeks to achieve exposure to the targeted factors subject to a set of reasonable constraints designed to foster portfolio diversification and liquidity.\n<br />\n<br />The investment universe is drawn primarily from securities in the FTSE Developed All-Cap Index (comprised of large, mid and small capitalisation securities in developed markets), and the Russell 3000 Index (comprised of the 3,000 largest publicly held companies in the US, and used to provide more access to US mid and small capitalisation securities).</p>",

The portfolio manager uses a rules-based quantitative model to evaluate the securities in an investment universe to construct an equity portfolio that seeks to achieve exposure to the targeted factors subject to a set of reasonable constraints designed to foster portfolio diversification and liquidity.\n<br />\n<br />The investment universe is drawn primarily from securities in the FTSE Developed All-Cap Index (comprised of large, mid and small capitalisation securities in developed markets), and the Russell 3000 Index (comprised of the 3,000 largest publicly held companies in the US, and used to provide more access to US mid and small capitalisation securities).</p>",
